# ../AnalysisData/tb_but_tidy.csv
This file is a tidied up and slightly modified version of the original data. Firstly it uses a more concise naming convention.

year - information about the year of examination
sex - sample patient's sex
age - sample patient's age
cases - amount of cases in each group
